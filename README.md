📊 Airbnb Data Analysis – Tableau Project

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb listings data to uncover insights into pricing, availability, location trends, and customer preferences. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders explore key business metrics and make data-driven decisions.

The project demonstrates:

1)Data cleaning and preparation for visualization
2)Interactive dashboards and KPIs
3)Storytelling with data to provide actionable insights

🎯 Objectives

1)Analyze pricing patterns across neighborhoods
2)Explore the relationship between property type, availability, and revenue
3)Identify the most popular neighborhoods and listings
4)Provide actionable insights for hosts and potential investors

📊 Dashboard Features

The Tableau dashboard includes:

1)KPIs: Total Listings, Avg. Price, Occupancy Rate, Revenue Trends
2)Interactive Filters: Neighborhood, Room Type, Price Range

3)Visualizations:
Price distribution across neighborhoods
Heatmap of popular locations
Availability and seasonal trends
Revenue comparison by room type
